**Background:**

1. com was the first online store in India.
  1. 18,000 products, 1000 brands, across 12 Indian cities
  2. Customer base of greater than 3,500,000
  3. Order growth rate 30%
2. USP: Customer Convenience
  1. &quot;Smart Basket&quot;
  2. &quot;Did you forget?&quot;
3. 30% customers place orders through smart phones
4. Order size is big
5. Order is very frequent

**What we need to do:**

1. Executive summary

**Key Issue &amp; Solution:**

1. With mobile, browsing and ordering is challenging.

Solution:

&quot; **Smart Basket&quot;** (purchase behavior analysis, clustering, predict)

Assist customer to automatically pick necessary grocery.

1. Customers forget items
  1. Place more frequent order -\&gt; financial impact, logistic cost
  2. Lose the order to local store

Solution:

&quot; **Did you forget?&quot;** (Product Recommendation, association rules)

Provide product recommendation while checking out.

**What we need to do:**

1. Problem statement/description

summarize the issue mentioned in the .pdf.

1. Objectives

To solve the issues, what kind of product/tool/technology we need to provide

1. Motivation

list and quantize the consequences brought by the problems

benefits from our solution

**Solution Details with AI technology:**

- **Data Description:**

- Descriptive analysis supported with figures/graphs
- Focus should be on extracting the initial story from the data

**What we need to do:**

1. Download the .csv dataset
2. (optional: label the items with common grocery category)
3. import the data to python/R, (I prefer Python) and clean the data properly
4. data mining by group the data and add calculated fields
  1. average #of items in one order
  2. max #item in one order
  3. most frequent bought item
  4. etc.…
5. Plot

- &quot; **Smart Basket&quot;** (purchase behavior analysis, clustering, predict)

- Model selection/justification/description
- Model estimation details

**Clustering methods**** ：**

  1. On customer (lack of customer info, only purchase behavior)
  2. On items

**Classification model**** ：**

1. Predict the item that can be in next purchase

- &quot; **Did you forget?&quot;** (Product Recommendation, association rules)

- Model selection/justification/description
- Model estimation details

Use association rule methods to find out the relationship between high frequently purchased items

Content-based recommendation system

**Results &amp; Recommendations:**

- Discussion and interpretation of the results using relevant marketing metrics.

**What we need to do:**

1. Interoperate the model result (clustering result, measure of predictive models)
- What should the executives do, as a result of your team&#39;s analysis? How does it add value for the organization?
- Combination of arts (weaving the story) &amp; science (ML) should be demonstrated in this part in driving the key message of taking the analytical approach to address problems.
1. Convert result from model to updates on the e-commerce site/app
For example: new recommendation system embedded in the app, new check-out page, new landing page, virtual assistant, and etc.

1. Value that the model and recommendation can bring (lower logistic cost, more market share, better customer review and reputation)
